# waifu2x (converter only version)

This is a reimplementation of waifu2x ([original](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x)) converter function, in C++, using OpenCV.
This is also a reimplementation of [waifu2x python version](https://marcan.st/transf/waifu2x.py) by [Hector Martin](https://marcan.st/blog/).
You can use this as command-line tool of image noise reduction or/and scaling.

This software was originally made by @WL-Amigo and has been improved a lot over the years, see [FORK_CHANGES.md](FORK_CHANGES.md) for more info on that.
